Restaurant recommendation System

 Recommendation system is one of the best tools that assist companies in increasing their revenues. For instance, 35% of amazon sales is from the recommendation system that the company implement. I am usually interested in reading reviews of restaurant because I donâ€™t like to waste my time and money on food that is not well prepared. In fact, I am not a person that would like to taste and then decide. Therefore, I chose the idea of my project to be a restaurant recommendation system.

For this project I will use Yelp dataset which is available on their website. I will explore the data by looking into it and summarizing it. Then move into the cleaning process. After that I will convert the raw text of the reviews into a quantifiable, meaningful format which is the heart of NLP. Then I will perform dimensionality reduction. Then I will use my model to create user profiles that form the basis for a recommendation system. 

To evaluate my unsupervised modeling results, I will use the approach of End-user feedback. I would like your approval to continue my project.
